# Hello-World


Hi, I am Zi. I am from Northeast China studying at Purdue University. I am an Engineering major with a passion of coding. 

I love developing games and working on coding projects with others. 
For leisure I love League of Legends, PUBG, Fornite, and Overwatch. I am not really good at any of these but hey, I am pretty well rounded.
